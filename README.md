## Technology Stack
Semantic technologies enable enterprise process models to be defined through a unified terminology which makes processes machine readable and empower their automatic validation, alignment, discovery and reuse. This project utilizes [SUPER Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105285_en.html) ontology stack as baseline for its semantic capabilities.

On the other hand, this project utilizes multi-agent technologies to simulate cognitive and social aspects of business experts and act like a digital assistants to support their routine tasks and business integrity controls. [WADE](http://jade.tilab.com/wadeproject/) platform is employed as baseline multi-agent platform implementation.
