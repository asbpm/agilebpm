AgileBPM is a framework for designing, discovering and executing knowledge-intensive business processes. The objective of this project is to augment, enrich and support business activities to make it easier for business experts to make more informed and accurate decisions. Platform provides a context aware infrastructure that detects physical and virtual stimulus, recognise the application context and performs the most appropriate business process alternative accordingly.

## Technology Stack
Semantic technologies enable enterprise process models to be defined through a unified terminology which makes processes machine readable and empower their automatic validation, alignment, discovery and reuse. This project utilizes [SUPER Project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/105285_en.html) ontology stack as baseline for its semantic capabilities.

On the other hand, this project utilizes multi-agent technologies to simulate cognitive and social aspects of business experts and act like a digital assistant to support their routine tasks and business integrity controls. [WADE](http://jade.tilab.com/wadeproject/) platform is employed as baseline multi-agent platform implementation.
